        <center><h1>INTRODUCTION</h1></center><br>
        <h3>Sri Iravatheswar Temple is located in Athimugam in Shoolagiri Taluk in Krishnagiri District of Tamil Nadu State, India. Sri Iravatheshwar temple in Athimugam, Hosur is believed to be a 1800 years old temple.</h3><br>

        <center><h1>HISTORY</h1></center><br>
        <h3>This is the temple where Indiran (King of Devas) and his vahana Iravadham got relieved of Brahmahathi dosham. As the Iravadham elephant (Vahana of Indiran) worshipped in this temple and got relieved of Brahmahathi dosham, the face of Iravadham could be seen on the Shiva lingam. Hasthi means Elephant in Sanskrit and mugam means face. The village is also known as Hasthimugam which later got changed to Athimugam. Mother Kamakshi Amman is gracing devotees in a standing form behind the Iravatheswar lingam within the same sanctum’s sanctorum (Garba Gruham).</h3><br>

        <center><h1>THE TEMPLE</h1></center><br>
        <h3>The temple has two presiding deities. Besides the one mentioned above, Lord Shiva in the form of Sri Alageshwara Swamy graces with Mother Akilandeswari in a different sanctum in this temple.</h3><br>

        <h3>There is an ancient anthill (generally called Pambu Puttru as snakes reside in them) in the southwest corner of this temple. This was of sand in the ancient days and later became too solid as a rock.</h3><br>

        <center><h1>Speciality in this Temple</h1></center><br>
            <h3>This temple is an Irratai sannithi temple ie. there are two moolavars. The Iravatheswar shrine has Appar and Thirugnana Sambandar statues. So it is believed that this temple should have been visited by them.</h3>
            <h3>This is also a temple of Sun Worship. Nandhi (Vahanam of Lord Shiva) is seated slightly away in front of Lord Iravatheswar leaving way for the Surya puja. The rays of Sun fall on the Lord during the first week of Tamil month of Thai (mid January to mid February). As Nandhi is on a side to facilitate Surya puja, other planets (navagrahas) are also in a calm and sitting form. The Navagrahas in this temple are in a calm and seated position.</h3>
            <h3>As the Iravadham elephant worshipped the Lord in this temple, the Shivalinga has that image on the face.</h3>
            <h3>There is a pancha lingam sannidhi with 5 Shiva lingams in 5 sanctums in a row with Nandhi in front of each Shiva linga.</h3>
            <h3>The Sthala viruksham is Vilva tree.  Vilva tree in this temple is about 1800 years old and it is said to be the very oldest, tallest and biggest in the world. The tree is still very lively and majestic.</h3>
            <h3>Lord Murugan is seen with his consorts Valli and Deivanai. Lord Murgan’s vahanam peacock is seen facing the left side of Lord Murugan and it is a rare thing to see.</h3>
            <h3>The temple is specifically beneficial for education and career growth. All the devotees who are thronging the temple now are beneficiaries of the lord by way of career growth and industrial growth. It is believed that praying to the Lord in this temple continuously for 5  pradosha will bring out huge change in one’s career. People pray for removal of obstacles in marriage , for child boon, achievements in education and career growth.</h3>
            <h3>The temple is almost 7 feet below the village and furthermore the suyambu lingam is 3 feet below the ground level of the temple.</h3>
