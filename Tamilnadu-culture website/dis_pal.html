        <h3>Kalainathaswamy Temple is located at Pallimadam, Virudhunagar District, on the banks of the Gundar
            River. Vira Pandya had built this sepulchral shrine (Pallippadai) at Pallimadam for his brother Sundara
            Pandya, a famous Pandya ruler. This shrine was earlier known as Pallippadai Sundara Pandya Isvaram
            Udayar Kovil, now it is called Kalainathaswamy Kovil. It is a unique sepulchral temple of its kind in
            Pandya Nadu.</h3><br>

        <center><h1>HISTORY</h1></center><br>
        <h3>Sundara Pandya, a 10th century AD Pandya ruler, famous for his erudition, died while visiting
            Pallimadam. He was buried there and his younger brother Vira Pandya (AD 946-966) erected a
            sepulchral shrine (Pallippadai) over his grave. The temple was known as Pallippadai Sundara Pandya
            Isvaram Udayar koil. It is now called Kalainathaswamy koil. The name Pallippadai has over the years
            been corrupted to Pallimadam. This sepulchral temple is the only one of its kind in Pandya Nadu.</h3>
            <center><h1>THE TEMPLE</h1></center><br>
            <h3>Kalainathaswamy Temple is located at Pallimadam, Virudhunagar District, on the banks of the Gundar
                River. There are two structures - Kalainathaswamy and Sornavalli Amman sannidhis. There is also a
                small pillared Mandapam for Nandhi in the front. The temple has a garbhagriha, ardhamandapa and
                mahamandapa. Everything is simple and plain without sculptures, which is typical of Pandya style
                architecture. The shrine for Shiva's consort lies on the right side of the main temple. She is known as
                Sornavalli Amman. The temple has the Nagara style of Vimana.</h3><br>
            <h3>The steps have a half-buried Vattezhuttu inscription that has details about a Kurandi Thirukattampalli, a
                Jain school. In total there are 16 inscriptions. "Stones used for the construction of the temple were
                brought from Kurandi village which had a dilapidated Jain temple. Inscription found at the temple also
                have details about the existence of a Jain school at Kurandi". Other inscriptions engraved in the temple
                mention about the various donations made to the temple.</h3><br>
            <h3>According to one of the inscriptions belonging to the period of King Veera Pandya (953 AD), Moovenda
                Velaan alias Arangam Poothi, Kilavan Arulali and Thatchan Ulagan and Maran Athichan alias
                Cholanthaga Pallavarayan of Puliyur donated lamps and sheep to the temple. During the same period,
                some Devaradiyars who were engaged in temple work also donated sheep towards the maintenance of
                the temple. The inscriptions bear the names of the donors as Kaavidhi Kanaipetral, Nithipetral, Nakan
                Kulangavilai etc.</h3><br>
            <h3>Though the temple was constructed during the 10th century, the temple was rebuilt and renovated during
                later Pandya rule. According to a later Pandya period inscription, one Sonaadan Nambi donated a
                doorjamb during renovation. The temple also has 17th century inscription that informs about the
                renovation undertaken by Sethupathi Raja. The pallippadai temple stands as a testimony for ancestor
                worship which was rampant in Tamil culture, as Veera Pandya wanted his brother to live as long as the
                sun and the moon.</h3><br>
            <h3>In Saivism, there were three sects namely Pasupatas, Kalamukhas and Kapalikas. Kalamukha sect
                priests named as Mahaviradhis settled here and looked after the temple's maintenance and
                administration. Kalamukhas priests established a mutt in the temple. Because of the presence of the
                mutt, the village came to be known as Pallimadam.</h3><br>
